## üöÄ Usage

Run the script from the command line:  
```bash
python doc_to_mp3.py --files <file_paths> --lang <language_code>
```

### **Arguments**
- `--files` (required): Paths to the input files (absolute or relative). Multiple files can be processed by providing space-separated paths.  
- `--lang` (required): Language code for text-to-speech (e.g., `en` for English, `ru` for Russian).    

### **Example**
Convert a `.pdf` file to an MP3 in English and save as `.mp3`:
```bash
python doc_to_mp3.py --files document.pdf --lang en
```

Convert multiple files at once:
```bash
python doc_to_mp3.py --files document.pdf document.docx --lang en
```

## üåç Supported Languages

The script supports all languages provided by Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).  
For the full list of available languages and their codes, refer to the [gTTS documentation](https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#languages).  

Some common examples:
- English: `en`  
- Russian: `ru`  
- Spanish: `es`  
- French: `fr`

## üõ† Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, ensure that:
1. The input file exists and is accessible.  
2. The file format is one of the supported types (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`).  
3. The language code is valid and supported by gTTS.  
4. Ensure there are no conflicts with file names if processing multiple files simultaneously.

## üí° Tips

- The script uses threading to process multiple files concurrently. This improves performance but be mindful of system resources.  
- You can customize the ASCII art logo in the `prepare_console` function.  
- If your document contains sensitive text, ensure it is secure before sharing the generated audio file.
